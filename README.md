# clickview-frontend

The code requires Vue, Bulma, jQuery to run.

Task 2: This is shown in the home tab on the app. (Completed)

Task 3: This is shown in the folders tab on the app. (Attempted)

Task 4: This is shown in the search tab on the app. (Completed)

To run the code, fork the repository and run the HTML file. There are tabs that will separate each task.

Some notes:
- I couldn't finish task 3 due to time constraints. I definitely think I can solve task 3 given an extra hour or two.
- Some errors took an hour to debug, but ended up working.
- I've only recently started learning Vue for this task, so I just copy-pasted the videos.js file into the Vue data component; I believe spending the time to research the correct way to reference the js file would have disadvantaged me here. However, I can learn how to do it for next time :)
- Reflecting on this, the 4-hour time limit was frustrating when the tasks were not working for hours, but I managed to solve each issue through planning on paper and locating the problem. Learnt a lot for Vue and JS too!
